# SeriesScore

A small personal tool to rate anime, manga, and novels out of 10.

It uses five criteria (story, characters, visuals/writing, world, and overall enjoyment) and then averages them into a final score. I originally built this as a simple way to keep my own ratings consistent and later cleaned up the UI and code.

### Live demo
https://abdulhadishah.github.io/SeriesScore/

### Tech used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What this project was for
An early project built as a lightweight scoring helper rather than a full review platform.

Nothing advanced here, just early work that I kept to track improvement over time.
