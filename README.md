# SeriesScore

A small personal tool to rate anime, manga, and novels out of 10.

It uses five criteria (story, characters, visuals/writing, world, and overall enjoyment) and then averages them into a final score. I originally built this as a simple way to keep my own ratings consistent and later cleaned up the UI and code.

### Live demo

### Tech used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- Vanilla JavaScript

### Notes

This is an early project that I’ve slowly improved over time.  
It’s not meant to be a full review platform, just a lightweight scoring helper.
